<p>Synesthesia- is an interactive digital campaign. It is a mixture of fashion and innovation. Our product is aimed at entertaining and educating the user. However, the fashion element of the campaign is the core element to the idea.  </p>
<p>We would like to proudly announce that Fred Perry SS 2014 collection is presented exclusively throughout the campaign: the colourful garments will open up the world of possibilities that sound and colour can build together.  </p>
<p>Let the fun begin!  </p>
